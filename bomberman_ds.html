			<p class="aside">This is a work in progress, and there is a lot of progress to go.</p>
			<h3>Version Differences</h3>
			<p>The US and Europe versions are functionally the exact same.</p>
			<p>However, in the Japanese version, the pause menu (from pressing Start) doesn't do give you an option to quit. Also, the game's intro (the 3D one before selecting the game type) is significantly shorter.</p>
			<p>Beyond that, I haven't noticed anything else that's affects gameplay.</p>
			<h3>Battle</h3>
			<p>You must do every battle with Hard CPUs. However, if you are already able to beat the game quickly in one sitting, this shouldn't be much of a problem. Here are some tips for specific stages:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>There's not much to say about <b>Normal</b>. Just look for good items and play.</li>
				<li><b>Classic</b> is good for people who are not used to the more extended set of items available in this game. Basically gather any positive item you can, as they will help.</li>
				<li>I skip to <b>Shield</b> because the voice-controlled ones will be unfairly weighted against certain runners. With your shield, you can lay bombs a bit quicker because you can stand closer to them when they explode. (remember to hold Y to activate the shield)</li>
				<li><b>Skull</b>s are bad. Don't touch them. Also look out for signs of the CPU having them so that you don't touch them. All the skull effects are as follows:</li>
				<ul style="margin-left:2em;">
					<li>Very slow walking</li>
					<li>Occasionally getting stunned</li>
					<li>Uncontrollably dropping bombs</li>
					<li>Not able to lay bombs</li>
				</ul>
				<li>For <b>Mystery Items</b>, you probably want to just grab all the items you can until you get Remote Control and then stop collecting them.</li>
				<li><b>Speedy</b> is my kind of stage.</li>
				<li>I'm pretty sure the CPU can "see through" the <b>Tunnels</b> to some degree. Probably better to just avoid those.</li>
				<li><b>Unipass</b> exists.</li>
				<li>In <b>Tripass</b>, I like to hang around the "open" area right outside the tunnels and lay as many bombs as I can in diagonals.</li>
				<li>Bombs explode almost exactly two tiles after being placed on a <b>Conveyor Belt</b>.</li>
				<li>You can change your direction while going through a <b>Trapdoor</b>. Make sure to not land on a bomb unless you intend to because it will make you bounce.</li>
				<li>For <b>Kick-Kick</b>, I sometimes just lay bombs in random places, kick them, and hope they get a CPU.</li>
				<li>If you can, try to lure your opponents to the <b>See-Saw</b> to bounce them off the stage.</li>
				<li><b>Full-Power</b> is where you really get to see the Hard CPU shine.</li>
				<li><b>Lotsa Items</b> is interesting. Try to formulate a route that gets you all the classic items you need, ending on a Remote Control. The CPU don't know when to stop gathering items, so they may end up having a worse combination than you.</li>
				<li><b>Mini-Mini</b> is the only stage that lets you spawn in the middle. This may make you end up closer to your opponents, and therefore able to kill them faster.</li>
				<li><b>Inferno</b> can get very difficult very fast. Just make sure to look everywhere because there are no hiding spots, as the game tells you.</li>
				<li>The <b>Spikes</b> aren't that dangerous. Just don't stand on them for too long, and don't forget that you can't hide behind them.</li>
				<li><b>Crown Battle</b>: Don't forget to change the Sets number to 3 for ILs. If you can, try to kill the CPU as fast as possible because this may make the journey to the Crown significantly faster.</li>
				<li><b>Merry-Go Crown</b>: Don't forget to change the Sets number to 3 for ILs. If you are racing a CPU, take shortcuts through the conveyor belts but try to avoid walking against them.</li>
				<li><b>Full-Power Crown</b>: The only stage where you will consistently get frustrated. If it helps, CPU will typically "focus" on defeating each other with bombs rather than trying to get to the Crown (and this goes for all three Crown stages). Therefore, if you can survive the first 5 seconds and get yourself into a tunnel, you can just break a line of blocks and win. (Playing with 1 CPU makes them target you exclusively, but that doesn't matter because it's less chaotic anyway.)</li>
				<li>The <b>Blocks</b> battle doesn't end until the time runs out or until everyone is dead. Therefore, if you can, try to get as many tiles as you can, then kill the CPUs and yourself.</li>
				<li><b>Kick Blocks</b> isn't much different from Blocks. Again, just eliminate all players after you have a good majority of tiles.</li>
				<li>I skip Zombie because there's absolutely no way to go any faster than the timer, and therefore it is essentially an autoscroller. Don't get stunned by the bombs in <b>Bom-Bom</b>.</li>
				<li>I think <b>Barom</b> is the only place the game tells you the name of anything. (I don't remember if I had the manual, but it would be long gone anyway.) You can usually wait for the CPU to run into a Barom if you're too far away to kill them quickly yourself.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>That's about it.</p>
			<h3>General item routing</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>In general, you want to collect any of the following items if you see them: Remote Control, Piercing Bombs (acrid bombs?), Invincible (not Fire Suit), the one that lets you walk through blocks (cannonball? cannibal?), Glasses, and Hearts.</li>
				<li>Power Glove and/or Boxing Glove can be useful in some circumstances as they let you stun enemies (I personally prefer the Power Glove but they work pretty much the same way). The Line Bomb may be useful for some bosses. The Clock is essentially required for at least Area 3-9. All other items (except the classic items) are useless.</li>
				<li>Use Hearts in any circumstance where you are about to die. Save the piercing bombs for Area 2-5, 2-9, 3-5, 3-9, etc. Save the Remote Controls for bosses and the last 2 worlds. Save the Invincibles, Glasses, and block walks for the last 2 worlds. If you have extra, you can also use them in Area 8.</li>
				<li>You can get to the main tab of items by pressing R. This also can help you get to Hearts quickly.</li>
				<li>On the Area screen, you can undo all newly used powerups by pressing B. This isn't very useful though because you shouldn't be equipping very many items on this screen.</li>
				<li>Until you're fully powered up, be ready to instantly equip any classic item you pick up, especially Speed Up.</li>
				<li>Whenever possible, equip all items while the course is starting (when Bomberman and the enemies are frozen). This is more efficient than spending extra time on the Area screen.
			</ul>
			<p>Every level has a unique set of items that is hardcoded into the game. Where they appear is effectively completely random, but they always show up:</p>
