			<p class="intro">This page covers some specifics regarding my setup for speedrunning and streaming games, mainly for clarification and integrity.</p>

      <h3>Gameboy, Gameboy Color, Gameboy Advance</h3>
      <p>Typically, since March of 2022, I play games for the Gameboy family on <strong>Gameboy Interface</strong>, which is an more flexible alternative to the Gameboy Player (it still requires a GameCube and the GBP hardware attachment, but serves to replace the expensive start-up disc and improve on some features). I use the "<strong>GBI-sr</strong>" (speedrunning) flavor, which aims to provide a low latency experience while not providing any unfair advantage in a speedrun context.</p>
      <p>My GameCube is a <strong>DOL-001 Japanese GameCube</strong>, which was hardmodded by the third-party seller to instead read discs from the NTSC-U region. It caame with an official <strong>DOL-003 controller</strong> (most likely with the main stick replaced), although I almost never use this for GBx/GBA games.<br />Instead, I use a <strong>Gameboy Advance SP</strong> as a controller, using the GBA-GC link cable (my cable is not an official product, but it works identically to the OEM ones as far as I can tell).</p>
      <p>I use a <strong>Everdrive GBA X5</strong> to play GBA games, and an <strong>Everdrive GB X5</strong> for GBx/GBC games (there is also a pricier model, the X7, which has extra features that I deemed unneccessary for my purposes). There are a couple games where I have regular access to an original cartridge; I may prefer this over an Everdrive depending on the circumstances.</p>
      <p>My streaming setup for the GameCube is fairly cheap, and it shows.</p>
	  <ul>
		<li>Through May 2022, I used an official Nintendo AV cable, going into a generic AV splitter. One branch of that went into an HDTV that came with my apartment unit (it's not ideal for analog input, but it mostly works); the other branch went into a generic AV->HDMI upscaler, which I had set to 720p60. This HDMI output then went into a generic HDMI capture (not the ultra junky, nigh-unusable models, but still fairly cheap). This is the typical low-end way to capture AV signals, and I spared every expense, but the gameplay was clear enough so I think it worked out.</li>
		<li>After moving in May 2022, I had to either use a different TV, which had about twice as much AV input lag, get an HDMI splitter, or go back to emulation. I resorted to emulation until I finally got a mid-tier splitter in August 2022.</li>
		<li>Since August 2022, I now plug the AV cable directly into the HDMI upscaler, and then split the HDMI input between the TV and the capture device. The end result looks almost identical, and now I can actually use the GameCube again (although I will still continue to use emulation fairly often; the only reason I didn't earlier in the year is because I didn't like the controller options I had).</li>
	  </ul>
      <p>If I'm emulating GB/GBC games, I use either <strong>BGB</strong> (whatever the latest version is) with "speedrun mode" activated, or <strong>BizHawk with the Gambatte core loaded</strong> (again, latest version). For both emulators, I use the official Nintendo BIOS.</p>
      <p>For emulating GBA games, I use <strong>BizHawk with the mGBA core loaded</strong>, and the official Nintendo BIOS loaded.</p>
	  <h3>DS/3DS</h3>
      <p>Typically I will run on my <strong>New Nintendo 2DS XL</strong>, which was completely unmodded until March 2022. Now, it has the typical homebrew packages on it (I won't go into those into detail), although this doesn't affect the loading of any cartridge games I have. (While I believe NDS-bootstrap loading also exhibits accurate timing, I don't really want to submit runs using it. Or if I do, I'll submit it as an emulator run.)<br />On the emulator side, I prefer to use MelonDS (whatever the latest version is), although in some rare cases I may have used other emulators (I don't recommend this, as MelonDS shows promise as being a much more accurate emulator for speedrunning purposes than any others).</p> 
      <p>I only run 3DS games on console (again with the New2DS), as emulation is generally not satisfactory for accuracy purposes. I don't have any physical copies of 3DS games currently; they all were purchased from the 3DS eShop while it was still readily accessible and thus are "digital" copies.</p>
      <p>Before the middle of August 2022, my "streaming setup" for my 3DS was very precarious, typically involving a smartphone held at an angle by various household objects, pointed at the console. I do not recommend doing this if you have a smartphone tripod (which I finally obtained) or are willing to get a 3DS capture card.</p>
      <h3>Other systems</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Gamecube: see above</li>
        <li>SNES/SFC: Modded SNES classic (using the same HDMI splitter and capture device), or SNES9x (latest version)</li>
		<li>Switch/SwitchVC: Switch V2 (using the same HDMI splitter and capture device)</li>
        <li>NES/FC: FCEUX (latest version)</li>
        <li>Anything else: I'll indicate necessary specifics in a video description or a run submission.</li>
      </ul>
	  <h3>Control methods</h3>
	  <p>I prefer a flat laptop keyboard for a lot of things, not because of any inherent advantages, but because of comfort and familiarity. My input scheme is inverted compared to typical WASD or controller layout, which is a bit annoying if I'm trying to transfer skills between different input methods.</p>
	  <p>I have used a few different controllers for emulation. The least offensive option I have is a SNES classic controller, which I connect to my computer with a raphnet adapter. I also have used a very old Logitech Dual Action contoller, which isn't a unique or special controller (other than the fact that it has a "disc" dpad, which I don't like).</p>
	  <p>In general, I prefer the "stock" option for playing on consoles, with the only exception being GBI, for which I use a GBA SP as described above. For Switch, I use joycons attached with an official Nintendo grip (or whatever they're called); I have tried the pro controller but I don't like the d-pad's precision.</p>
	  <h3>Programs and websites</h3>
	  <ul>
	    <li>FramePerfect (mobile speedrun timer)</li>
		<li>LiveSplit (speedrun timer), using Counter, Focused Hotkeys, LiveSplit Server, Speedguides Live, and Split Name Auto Incrementer components. I use Speedguides Live if I want to display text in OBS based on the split. I use LiveSplit Server along with LiveSplit Remote for Android if I'm too far away from my laptop to split with the keyboard.</li>
		<li>LosslessCut (video trimmer)</li>
		<li>Minipadder (controller input overlay): This was a web-based controller input display with some nice features, which was abandoned in early 2022 but seems to have been continued again. When I originally found that it was discontinued, I started running it locally instead of from the website (and I will continue to do so since it is quicker to customize when you have full access to the configuration files). I tweaked the "Super Pad" layout to match the control configuration and visual style of my SNES classic controller; if there aren't purple and pink buttons on the overlay then I was using the Logitech Dual Action controller.</li>
		<li>NohBoard (keyboard input overlay)</li>
		<li>OBS Studio (streaming/recording program)</li>
		<li>somewes.com Frame Count (video retimer)</li>
		<li>splits.io (web-based split sharing/analysis): the long-standing website for this purpose, with integration into speedrun.com and LiveSplit. There is a subscription service associated with more comparison and analysis features, but I don't use this.</li>
		<li>Streamlabs for Android (mobile streaming): I really don't like using this, but it's the only option for high quality phone streaming that I have access to.</li>
		<li>therun.gg (web-based split sharing/analysis): a newer project that so far seems to offer similar features to paid splits.io, but without paying. I also use the Twitch extension to show run details in the About panel of my channel.</li>
