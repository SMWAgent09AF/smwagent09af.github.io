			<p class="intro">This page covers some specifics regarding my setup for speedrunning and streaming games, mainly for clarification and integrity.</p>

      <h3>Gameboy, Gameboy Color, Gameboy Advance</h3>
      <p>Typically, since March of 2022, I play games for the Gameboy family on <strong>Gameboy Interface</strong>, which is an more flexible alternative to the Gameboy Player (it still requires a GameCube and the GBP hardware attachment, but serves to replace the expensive start-up disc and improve on some features). I use the "<strong>GBI-sr</strong>" (speedrunning) flavor, which aims to provide a low latency experience while not providing any unfair advantage in a speedrun context.</p>
      <p>My GameCube is a <strong>DOL-001 Japanese GameCube</strong>, which was hardmodded by a third party to instead read discs from the NTSC-U region. It caame with an official <strong>DOL-003 controller</strong> (most likely with the main stick replaced), although I almost never will use this for GBx/GBA games.<br />Instead, I use a <strong>Gameboy Advance SP</strong> as a controller, using the GBA-GC link cable (my cable is not an official product, but it works identically to the OEM ones as far as I can tell).</p>
      <p>I use a <strong>Everdrive GBA X5</strong> to play GBA games, and an <strong>Everdrive GB X5</strong> for GBx/GBC games (there is also a pricier model, the X7, which has extra features that I deemed unneccessary for my purposes).</p>
      <p>My streaming setup for the GameCube is fairly cheap, and it shows. I use an official Nintendo AV cable, going into a generic AV splitter &emdash; one branch of that goes into an HDTV that came with my apartment unit (it's not ideal for analog input, but it mostly works); the other branch goes into a generic AV->HDMI upscaler, which I have set to 720p60. This HDMI output then goes into a generic HDMI capture (not the ultra cheap, nigh-unusable models, but the next level up). This is the typical low-end way to capture AV signals, and I spared every expense, but the gameplay is clear enough so I think it works out.</p>
      <p>On the emulator side, I use either <strong>BGB</strong> (whatever the latest version is) with "speedrun mode" activated, or <strong>BizHawk with the Gambatte core loaded</strong> (again, latest version).</p>
      <h3>DS/3DS</h3>
      <p>I haven't run too many DS games, but typically I will run on my <strongNew Nintendo 2DS XL</strong>, which was completely unmodded until March 2022. Now, it has the typical homebrew packages on it (I won't go into those into detail), although this doesn't affect the loading of any cartridge games I have. (I believe NDS-bootstrap loading also exhibits accurate timing, although I'm not 100% sure. If I want to run a game this way, I will discuss it with a game's community or indicate it in the run submission.)<br />On the emulator side, I prefer to use MelonDS (whatever the latest version is), although in some rare cases I may have used other emulators (I don't recommend this, as MelonDS shows promise as being a much more accurate emulator for speedrunning purposes than any others).</p> 
      <p>I only run 3DS games on console (again with the New2DS), as emulation is generally not satisfactory for accuracy purposes. I don't have any physical copies of 3DS games; they all were purchased from the 3DS eShop while it was still readily accessible and thus are "digital" copies.</p>
      <p>My "streaming setup" for my 3DS changes every time I attempt to use it. It typically involves a smartphone precariously held at an angle by various household objects, pointed at the console. I do not recommend doing this if you have a smartphone tripod or are willing to get a 3DS capture card.</p>
      <h3>Other systems</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Gamecube: see above</li>
        <li>SNES/SFC: Modded SNESClassic, or SNES9x (latest version)</li>
        <li>NES/FC: FCEUX (latest version)</li>
        <li>Anything else: I'll indicate necessary specifics in a video description or a run submission.</li>
