## Intro
This site started as a dumping ground for manually transferring data from my old Google Sites pages. I did this primarily because I was getting tired of Google Sites' styling/flexibility quirks, and the styles and layout I had on that site were ancient, having barely been changed since 2016. Having accomplished this for some (at the time) more relevant pages, I decided to expand my knowledge of HTML/CSS, and also learn some javascript.

Unfortunately, legacy Google Sites have been shut down, and I don't think the new Google Sites has the features I want for any new content that I would have put there (I had left the platform as a whole behind anyway). Thus, this is all that's left, and I don't think I'll end up transferring the rest of the pages over, despite having automatic backups of them.

That's all. This is just a static website with a couple scripting embellishments; nothing fancy to see here.
