## Intro
This is a current project of mine in which I will be manually transferring all of the information in my [site on Google Sites](https://sites.google.com/site/smwagent09afplus). I am doing this primarily because I am getting tired of Google Sites' limitations on styling and flexibility, and the styles and layout I have on that site are ancient, having barely been changed since 2016. I also would like to get back into HTML and CSS because it is the only language I knew well or formally learned. I also decided to bite the bullet and figure out how to use Git.

That's all. This is literally just a static website; nothing fancy to see here.
